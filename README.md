# Whitesloth Search
ðŸ”Ž Based on the DuckDuckGo API, WhiteSloth Search is a simple search interface accessible to all, providing results in just a few sentences, while respecting your privacy and confidentiality. The results are in text-only format to avoid masses of information that can be seen on big search engine like Google.

ðŸŒ´ The cool jungle theme adds a relaxing atmosphere while you search. Please contact me if you have any idea or tips to add details to make the scene more enjoyable !

ðŸ¦¥ The white sloth is very lazy, so to have any chance of getting results, search for simple keywords only such as "Sloth" or "Jungle". It provides only short definitions or description of objects, places or personnalities. So while searching, try to imagine typing in an online encyclopedia search bar like Wikipedia.
